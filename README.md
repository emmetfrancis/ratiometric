# ratiometric
MATLAB functions used to calculate changes in ratiometric calcium signals over time

calciumRatiometric.m is used to analyze image ratios over time and convert to calcium concentrations based on the calibration from my dissertation.
modalIntensity.m is a function which can be used to calculate the modal background intensity (optionally used within calciumRatiometric)
